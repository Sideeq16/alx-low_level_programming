Requiescat
by oscar wilde

Tred lightly, she is near
under the snow,
speak gently, she can hear
The daisies grow.

All here bright golden hair
Tranished with rst,
She that was young and fair
Fallen to dust.

lily-like, white as snow,
she hardly knew
She was a woman, so 
sweetly she grew.

Coffin-board, heavy stone,
Lie on her breast,
I ves my heart alone,
she is at rest.

Peace, Peace, she cannot hear
Lyre or snonnet,
All my life's uried here,
Heap earth upon it.
